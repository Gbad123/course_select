## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine

### Prerequisites

All you'll need is an environment where you can run [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/). Follow the instructions at their website to get python3 running on your machine.

### Installation

No installation necessary. Simply download this repository to your local machine.

## Running the Program

Ensure you can run [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) on your machine. Open a terminal in the local directory with your copy of the program.

GCQ currently uses a command line interface (CLI). Once you have your terminal open run the following command:

```
python3 cli.py
```

For more information how to use the CLI go to the [WIKI](https://gitlab.socs.uoguelph.ca/cis-4250-team-8/cis4250/-/wikis/CLI%20Usage%20and%20Settings).

## Running the Tests

Our unit tests are stored in 'cis4250/tests/'. To run the tests on your machine run the following command from the root folder:  

```
python3 -m unittest
```
