The information published in this Undergraduate Calendar outlines the rules, regulations, curricula, programs and fees for the 2020-2021 academic year, including the Summer
Semester 2020, the Fall Semester 2020 and the Winter Semester 2021.
The University reserves the right to change without notice any information contained in this calendar, including but not limited to that related to tuition and other fees, standards of
admission, course delivery or format, continuation of study, and the offering or requirements for the granting of, degrees or diplomas in any or all of its programs. The publication
of this calendar does not bind the University to the provision of courses, programs, schedules of study, or facilities as listed herein.
The University will not be liable for any failure or delay in performance arising out of any cause or causes beyond its reasonable control. Such causes may include but are not limited
to fire, strike, lock-out, inability to procure materials or trades, war, mass-casualty event, flood, local, regional or global outbreak of disease or other public health emergency, social
distancing or quarantine restriction, legislative or regulatory requirements, unusually severe weather, failure of public utility or common carrier, or attacks or other malicious act,
including but not limited to attacks on or through the internet, or any internet service, telecommunications provider or hosting facility.
In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic of the virus leading to COVID-19. The Governments of Canada, the Province of Ontario, and local
Governments responded to the pandemic with legislative amendments, controls, orders, by-laws, requests and requirements (collectively, the “Governmental Response”). It is uncertain
how long the pandemic, and the related Governmental Response, will continue, and it is unknown whether there may be a resurgence of the virus leading to COVID-19 or any mutation
thereof (collectively, the “Virus”) and resulting or supplementary renewed Government Response. Without limiting the foregoing paragraph, the University shall not be liable for
costs associated with any failure or delay in performance arising out of:
a. the continued spread of the Virus;
b. the continuation of or renewed Governmental Response to control the spread of the Virus; and
c. a University decision, made on an organization-wide basis and in good faith, to control the spread of the Virus, even if exceeding the then current specific Government Response.
In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic may necessitate a revision of the format of course offerings such that courses are offered in whole or in part on an alternate delivery model to
in-person classes. Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of
the academic year.
Dates or times of performance including the Schedule of Dates may be extended as appropriate and the University will notify students promptly of the existence and nature of such
delay and shall, so far as practicable, use reasonable efforts to minimize and mitigate any such delay or non-performance.

Learning Outcomes
On December 5, 2012, the University of Guelph Senate approved five University-wide Learning Outcomes as the basis from which to guide the development of undergraduate degree
programs, specializations and courses:
1. Critical and Creative Thinking
2. Literacy
3. Global Understanding
4. Communicating
5. Professional and Ethical Behaviour
These learning outcomes are also intended to serve as a framework through which our educational expectations are clear to students and the broader public; and to inform the process
of outcomes assessment through the quality assurance process (regular reviews) of programs and departments.
An on-line guide to the learning outcomes, links to the associated skills, and detailed rubrics designed to support the development and assessment of additional program and
discipline-specific outcomes, are available for reference on the Learning Outcomes website.
1. Critical and Creative Thinking
Critical and creative thinking is a concept in which one applies logical principles, after much inquiry and analysis, to solve problems with a high degree of innovation, divergent
thinking and risk taking. Those mastering this outcome show evidence of integrating knowledge and applying this knowledge across disciplinary boundaries. Depth and breadth of
understanding of disciplines is essential to this outcome.
In addition, Critical and Creative Thinking includes, but is not limited to, the following outcomes: Inquiry and Analysis; Problem Solving; Creativity; and Depth and Breadth
of Understanding.
2. Literacy
Literacy is the ability to extract information from a variety of resources, assess the quality and validity of the material, and use it to discover new knowledge. The comfort in using
quantitative literacy also exists in this definition, as does using technology effectively and developing visual literacy.
In addition, Literacy includes, but is not limited to, the following outcomes: Information Literacy, Quantitative Literacy, Technological Literacy, and Visual Literacy.
3. Global Understanding:
Global understanding encompasses the knowledge of cultural similarities and differences, the context (historical, geographical, political and environmental) from which these arise,
and how they are manifest in modern society. Global understanding is exercised as civic engagement, intercultural competence and the ability to understand an academic discipline
outside of the domestic context.
In addition, Global Understanding includes, but is not limited to, the following outcomes: Global Understanding, Sense of Historical Development, Civic Knowledge and
Engagement, and Intercultural Competence.
4. Communicating
Communicating is the ability to interact effectively with a variety of individuals and groups, and convey information successfully in a variety of formats including oral and written
communication. Communicating also comprises attentiveness and listening, as well as reading comprehension. It includes the ability to communicate and synthesize information,
arguments, and analyses accurately and reliably.
In addition, Communicating includes, but is not limited to, the following outcomes: Oral Communication, Written Communication, Reading Comprehension, and Integrative
Communication.
5. Professional and Ethical Behaviour
Professional and ethical behaviour requires the ability to accomplish the tasks at hand with proficient skills in teamwork and leadership, while remembering ethical reasoning behind
all decisions. The ability for organizational and time management skills is essential in bringing together all aspects of managing self and others. Academic integrity is central to
mastery in this outcome.
In addition, Professional and Ethical Behaviour includes, but is not limited to, the following outcomes: Teamwork, Ethical Reasoning, Leadership, and Personal Organization
and Time Management

Revision: 2020-2021 Undergraduate Calendar
Table of Contents i
XII. Course Descriptions
General Information
Course Labelling and Levels
Each course is identified by a two-part code. The first part of the code refers to the subject
area, the second to the level of the course. Thus, the course PSYC*3570 is a course in the
subject area of Psychology (PSYC*XXXX), and is of a level that places it among courses
in the 3000 series. The series 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 numbers are intended to indicate
progressively more demanding content, and correspondingly increasing competence on
the part of the students enrolled in the course. Courses in the 1000 series are mainly for
first year students, those in the 2000 series are mainly for second year students, and those
in the 3000 series are for third year students. Similarly, courses in the 4000 series are
mainly intended to be taken by students in the fourth year of honours programs. It is
important that students planning their courses have clearly in mind the significance of
these numbers so that they may guard against undertaking course work at levels for which
they are insufficiently prepared. A two-semester course (e.g. AGR*2351/2) is taken over
2 continuous semesters and counts as 1 course attempt per semester for classification,
continuation of study and calculation of fees. Two-semester courses cannot be split.
Course Information
The letters S, F, W indicate the University's intention to offer the course in the Summer
(S), Fall (F) or Winter (W) semester during the academic year covered by this Calendar.
Although courses normally will be offered in the semester indicated, students preparing
their course programs are advised to consult the Undergraduate Course Timetable. The
University cannot guarantee that all courses will be offered in the exact semester indicated.
The letter U indicates that an intended offering has not been assigned to the course.
Students should consult the Undergraduate Course Timetable posted on WebAdvisor or
contact the departments offering those courses to determine the semester offerings.
The figures in parentheses ( ) following the semester designation are a general guide to
the lecture and laboratory contact hours per week, the first digit being the number of
lecture hours and the second, the number of laboratory hours. The credit weight for each
course appears in brackets [ ]. A credit weight of [0.50] indicates 10-12 student effort
hours, including class time, on academic tasks associated with the course.
Detailed course descriptions are maintained at the office of the department offering the
course. Some courses, designated "Experiential Learning" courses in the Calendar
description, are deliberately designed to accommodate the need to grant academic credit
for experiential learning external to regular courses, in such contexts as co-operative
education, field observation/job shadowing, internship/externships, practical, service
learning, or work study (and other approved experience). Prior approval for admission to
these courses must be obtained from the department and instructor concerned.
Course Prerequisites
In lists of course prerequisites, "or" conditions are spelled out explicitly, but "and"
conditions are indicated with a comma "," . For example: "CSTU*2270, FRHD*2010,
NUTR*2010" means "CSTU*2270 and FRHD*2010 and NUTR*2010". A number of
courses have stated prerequisites which are prior requirements for entry to the course.
Students who do not satisfy course prerequisites, or who in the opinion of the instructor
do not possess an equivalent background to that of the stated prerequisites, are not eligible
to enroll in the course. When some specific background is desirable but not required, the
course description will include a statement of recommended background. It is understood
that the instructor may accept equivalent courses from other institutions in place of the
stated prerequisites. Students who wish to enroll in courses for which they do not have
the stated prerequisite(s) must obtain instructor approval as outlined in Section VIII,
Undergraduate Degree Regulations and Procedures, in this Calendar.
Course Equates and Restrictions
Equates - Equate indicates a course identical to the one under which it is listed. The
course may have been re-numbered or may be cross-listed under two subject areas.
Students will not be permitted to register in equated courses.
Restrictions - A restriction is a "rule" that is placed on the computer system (Colleague)
at the direction of an academic department so that particular students may not register in
particular courses. The course may be restricted because there is sufficient over-lap in
content with another course so that it is inappropriate for the student to take a similar
course for credit. In a different instance, the course may be restricted by "Instructor
Consent" so that the student must discuss the special requirements of the course with the
instructor before enrolling. Or, alternatively, the restriction may reflect a "PriorityAccess"
designation for enrolment management purposes. (See Priority Access).
